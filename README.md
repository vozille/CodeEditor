# CodeEditor
A code editor written in python. Started as a small project to implement auto-complete code by using Trie data structure

Current status after 15 days:

- Autocomplete done
- Supports c++ and python2


Usage:
- The left frame represents line numbers
- The middle frame is where you write the code
- The right frame is where you specify input (if any)
- The frame at the bottom represents the output, it shows the results of compile/run

Issuses:
- Autocomplete window can look much better
- Open_highlight method needs fixing

Usage:
-The left frame represents line numbers
-The middle frame is where you write the code
-The right frame is where you specify input (if any)
-The frame at the bottom represents the output, it shows the results of compile/run

Issuses:
-Autocomplete window can look much better
-Open_highlight method needs fixing

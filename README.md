# CodeEditor
A code editor written in python. Started as a small project to implement auto-complete code by using Trie data structure

Current status after 25 days:
- fixed autocomplete
- changed design slightly
- added tabs


Usage:
- The left frame represents line numbers
- The middle frame is where you write the code
- The right frame is where you specify input (if any)
- The autocomplete appears at the bottom, press down and tab to select and insert the word
- The frame at the bottom represents the output, it shows the results of compile/run

Issuses:
- slight bugs with custom syntax highlight
- Add java support
- Add a light theme

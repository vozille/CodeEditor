# CodeEditor
A code editor written in python-2.7 using all built-in libraries. Started as a small project to implement auto-complete code by using Trie data structure

**I am taking a break from this now, it works fine**

Current status after 1 month:
- fixed autocomplete
- changed design slightly
- added tabs


Usage:
- The left frame represents line numbers
- The middle frame is where you write the code
- The right frame is where you specify input (if any)
- The autocomplete appears at the bottom, press down and tab to select and insert the word
- The frame at the bottom represents the output, it shows the results of compile/run

Issuses:
- __add any issuse here__

TODO:
- Add java support
- Add a light theme
